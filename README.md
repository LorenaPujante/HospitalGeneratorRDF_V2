# HospitalGeneratorRDF_V2
**HospitalGeneratorRDF_V2** is an updated version of the software presented in [HospitalGeneratorRDF](https://github.com/LorenaPujante/HospitalGeneratorRDF). Compared to the previous version, the changes are related to achieving a hospital design with some specific characteristics. This software has been used in the work "TODO: HACER PAPER" with DOI [~~doi: TODO~~](NULL) to create the dataset used for the experiments. 

As its previous version, **HospitalGeneratorRDF_V2** is a software that, based on the output of [_H-Outbreak_](https://github.com/denissekim/Simulation-Model) (a simulation model of the movements of patients inside a hospital), creates a knowledge graph (KG) in RDF and RDF* according to the data model presented in "_Spatiotemporal Data Modelling for Epidemiological Research in Hospitals_" ([10.1109/JBHI.2024.3417224](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568325)) with the little changes presented in [HospitalKG_changes](https://github.com/LorenaPujante/HospitalKG_Changes).

Since H-Outbreak does not cover all the classes and relations from the data model, HospitalGeneratorRDF completes it by adding _Floors_, _Areas_, _Corridors_, _Rooms_, _Beds_, _Services_ and _Hospitalization Units_, and the relations between them. It also creates different subclasses of _Events_: _Hospitalization_, _Radiology_, _Surgery_ and _Death_.
