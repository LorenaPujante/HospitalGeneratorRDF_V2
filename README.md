# HospitalGeneratorRDF_V2
**HospitalGeneratorRDF_V2** is an updated version of the software presented in [HospitalGeneratorRDF](https://github.com/LorenaPujante/HospitalGeneratorRDF). Compared to the previous version, the changes are related to achieving a hospital design with some specific characteristics. This software has been used in the work "TODO: HACER PAPER" with DOI [~~doi: TODO~~](NULL) to create the dataset used for the experiments. 

As its previous version, **HospitalGeneratorRDF_V2** is a software that, based on the output of [_H-Outbreak_](https://github.com/denissekim/Simulation-Model) (a simulation model of the movements of patients inside a hospital), creates a knowledge graph (KG) in RDF and RDF* according to the data model presented in "_Spatiotemporal Data Modelling for Epidemiological Research in Hospitals_" ([10.1109/JBHI.2024.3417224](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568325)) with the little changes presented in [HospitalKG_changes](https://github.com/LorenaPujante/HospitalKG_Changes).

Since H-Outbreak does not cover all the classes and relations from the data model, HospitalGeneratorRDF completes it by adding _Floors_, _Areas_, _Corridors_, _Rooms_, _Beds_, _Services_ and _HospitalizationUnits_, and the relations between them. It also creates different subclasses of _Events_: _Hospitalization_, _Radiology_, _Surgery_ and _Death_.

## 1. Changes over HospitalGeneratorRDF
We have based several characteristics of the hospital on the main building of the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Clinical Hospital, Region of Murcia, Spain. These characteristics are:
- Number of _Services_ for hospitalisations
- Number of _HospitalizationUnits_ (_HU_) per _Service_
- Number of operating theatres.
- Number of rooms for radiology and other diagnostic imaging techniques (we will call all of them as _radiology_).
- Number of beds for A&E
- Number of beds for Intensive Care (IC)

The hospital will have four _Floors_:
- _**Ground Floor**_: In thi _Floor_ there will be: ICU rooms, A&E rooms, radiology rooms and operating theatres.
- _**Upper Floor**_: These 3 _Floors_ will be used for hospitalisations.   

Next, there is a brief description of the services and each kind of _Floor_.

### 1.1. Services
The hospital will have:
- **17** Services for _Hospitalisations_.
- **1** Service for _Radiology_.
- **1** Service for _A&E_.
- **1** Service for _IC_.
- There isn't a _Service_ for only surgeries. Each _Service_ will be in charge of its own surgeries.

Below, we present the distribution of _HospitalizationUnits_ per _Service_:
- The 17 _Services_ for hospitalisations, the A&E _Service_ and the IC _Service_ will have each **1** _HU_ for **surgeries**.
- _A&E Service_ will have **1** _HU_ for patient stays.
- _IC Service_ will have **1** _HU_ for patient stays.
- _Radiology Service_ will have **6** _HU_.
- The _Services for hospitalisations_ will have a certain number of _HospitalizationUnits_. There will be:
  - **8** Services with **1** _HU_. These _Services_ are: _S0_, _S1_, _S2_, _S10_, _S11_, _S12_ and _S13_.
  - **3** Services with **2** _HU_. These _Services_ are: _S2_, _S6_ and _S8_.
  - **4** Services with **3** _HU_. These _Services_ are: _S3_, _S4_, _S9_ and _S16_.
  - **1** Services with **4** _HU_. This _Service_ is: _S7_.
  - **1** Services with **5** _HU_. This _Service_ is: _S15_.
  - **1** Services with **6** _HU_. This _Service_ is: _S14_.


### 1.2. Ground Floor
This _Floor_ has a layout with **2 rows** (_Units_) and **5** _columns_ (_Blocks_). In this _Floor_ there will be:
- _Operating theatres_: **27**. Each operating theatre will have **1 _Bed_**
- _Rooms for Radiology_: **24**. Each room will have **1 _Bed_**. <br> The distribution of _Rooms_ per _HU_ is:
  - **1** _HU_ with **8** _Rooms_.
  - **2** _HU_ with **2** _Rooms_.
  - **3** _HU_ with **3** _Rooms_.
- _A&E Rooms_: **4** _Rooms_. Each room will have **4 _Beds_**. In total, there will be **16** _A&E Beds_.
- _IC Rooms_: **4** _Rooms_. Each room will have **5 _Beds_**. In total, there will be **20** _IC Beds_.    

The following figure shows a schematic representation of the _ground Floor_ with its _Areas_ and the number of _Corridors_ and _Rooms_ in each.

### 1.3. Upper Floors for Hospitalisations
There will be 3 _Floors_ for hospitalisations over the ground floor. These three _Floors_ will have layouts with **2 rows** (_Units_) and **4** _columns_ (_Blocks_). The number and distribution of the _Corridors_ will depend on the number of _Rooms_ on each _Floor_, and it is assigned following the same process as the first version of this software. The total number of _Rooms_ in the hospital is random, but it is approximately **320**. These _Rooms_ will be distributed evenly between the three _Floors_. So, there will be **105** _Rooms_ per _Floor_, approximately.

The 17 _Services_ for hospitalisations will be distributed between these three _Floors_ such that each _Floor_ has **13** _HU_ and none _Service_ is divided between two _Floors_. Specifically, this will be the _Services_ per _Floor_:
- _Floor 1_: **7** _Services_ (_S0_-_S6_), **13** _HU_.
- _Floor 2_: **7** _Services_ (_S7_-_S13_), **13** _HU_.
- _Floor 3_: **3** _Services_ (_S14_-_S16_), **14** _HU_.

We have refined the random _Floor_ generation algorithm to balance the number of _Corridors_ and _Rooms_ per _Area_.

Eac _HU_ will have **8Â±2** _Rooms_ with the following probability:
- **8** _Rooms_: 50%
- **7** _Rooms_: 15%
- **9** _Rooms_: 15%
- **6** _Rooms_: 10%
- **10** _Rooms_: 10%

### 1.4. Changed files
The changed files are the following:
- HOLA
  
## 2. Installation
The source code is currently hosted on [github.com/LorenaPujante/HospitalGeneratorRDF](https://github.com/LorenaPujante/HospitalGeneratorRDF_V2).

The program is in Python 3.10, and no external packages are needed.


## 3. Input
The input for HospitalGeneratorRDF_V2 must be:
- The two files obtained as output from H-Outbreak: `movements.csv` and `patients.csv`.
- Two additional files that are obtained by adding new code to H-Outbreak.
  - `hospital.txt`: It file has a CSV-like representation of the layout of beds and wards from the H-Outbreak output.
  - `roomsHU.txt`: Each line of this file represets the triplet (_Service_, _HU_ inside the _Service_, number of _Rooms_ of the _HU_)

### 3.1. Modifications over H-Outbreak
To get the extra files and ,
we need to modify two files from H-Outbreak: _hospital.py_ and _simulation.py_
